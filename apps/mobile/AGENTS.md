# Flutter MVVM Architecture Rules

## Architecture

Always follow:

View
→ ViewModel
→ Repository
→ Supabase

Never skip layers.

Views must never access Supabase directly.

Views must never contain business logic.

Repositories must contain all Supabase queries.

---

## Folder Structure

Always use:

lib/
├── core/
├── features/
│   ├── auth/
│   ├── products/
│   ├── categories/
│   ├── customers/
│   ├── orders/
│   ├── payments/
│   ├── staff/
│   ├── branches/
│   ├── reports/
│   └── settings/

Every feature must contain:

models/
repositories/
viewmodels/
views/
widgets/

Never create random folders.

---

## MVVM Rules

Views:
- UI only
- No business logic
- No Supabase calls
- No complex calculations

ViewModels:
- Manage state
- Call repositories
- Handle loading and error states
- No UI widgets

Repositories:
- Supabase queries only
- CRUD operations only
- Return typed models

---

## State Management

Use Riverpod only.

Do not use:
- Provider
- GetX
- Bloc
- setState for business state

Use:
- AsyncNotifier
- Notifier
- Riverpod Generator

Prefer code generation.

---

## Navigation

Use GoRouter only.

Do not use Navigator.push directly.

All routes must be registered centrally.

---

## Models

Use Freezed.

Every model must have:

- fromJson
- toJson
- copyWith
- equality support

Never create manual model classes when Freezed can be used.

---

## Supabase

All Supabase access must go through repositories.

Never access:

Supabase.instance.client

inside views.

Create a central Supabase service.

Use dependency injection.

---

## Repository Pattern

Example:

ProductView
↓
ProductViewModel
↓
ProductRepository
↓
Supabase

Never:

ProductView
↓
Supabase

---

## Error Handling

Always use try/catch.

Return meaningful errors.

Never use empty catches.

Never swallow exceptions.

---

## Loading States

Every async action must support:

- Loading
- Success
- Error

Use AsyncValue.

---

## Naming Convention

Screens:

product_list_screen.dart
product_detail_screen.dart

ViewModels:

product_viewmodel.dart

Repositories:

product_repository.dart

Models:

product.dart

Widgets:

product_card.dart

Use snake_case filenames.

---

## UI Rules

Use:

- Material 3
- Responsive layouts
- Reusable widgets

Avoid duplicated UI.

Extract repeated widgets.

---

## Performance

Use:

- const widgets
- pagination
- lazy loading
- cached_network_image

Avoid unnecessary rebuilds.

Use Riverpod selectors where possible.

---

## Code Quality

Always:

- Use strict typing
- Use final whenever possible
- Use async/await
- Keep files focused

Avoid:

- dynamic
- any-like patterns
- huge widgets over 500 lines

---

## Feature Development Checklist

When creating a new feature:

1. Create model
2. Create repository
3. Create ViewModel
4. Create screens
5. Create widgets
6. Register routes
7. Add tests

Follow MVVM strictly.

---

## Critical Rules

Never modify architecture without permission.

Never call Supabase from UI.

Never place business logic in widgets.

Never duplicate models.

Never create multiple repositories for the same entity.

Always reuse existing ViewModels and repositories when possible.
